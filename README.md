## EXPERIMENTAL! NOT YET WORKING

This is me, a novice, total-swift-n00b, day-to-day React Native iOS&Android webdev guy trying to sidecar the Bun runtime into React Native Mac OS so that I can build desktop apps which can run bundled TS/JS-code because I'm to lazy to learn how package any of the other languages I already know.
